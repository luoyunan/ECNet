## Overview
ECNet (evolutionary context-integrated neural network) is a deep learning model that guides protein engineering by predicting protein fitness from the sequence. It integrates local evolutionary context from homologous sequences that explicitly model residue-residue epistasis for the protein of interest with the global evolutionary context that encodes rich semantic and structural features from the enormous protein sequence universe. Please see our *Nature Communications* [paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25976-8) for details.

## Installation
Clone and export the GitHub repository directory to python path
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luoyunan/ECNet.git
cd ECNet
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH
```
## Dependencies
This package is tested with `Python 3.7` and `CUDA 10.1` on `Ubuntu 18.04`, with access to an Nvidia GeForce TITAN X GPU (12GB RAM) and Intel Xeon E5-2650 v3 CPU (2.30 GHz, 512G RAM). Please see `requirements.txt` for necessary python dependencies, all of which can be easily installed with `pip` or `conda`. Due to an issue of installing `pytorch 1.4.0` with `pip`, please install `pytorch` with `conda` first.
```bash
conda install pytorch==1.4.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Example
1. Download example data (~5.4MB) from Dropbox.
    ```
    wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/nkgubuwfwiyy0ze/data.tar.gz
    tar xf data.tar.gz
    ```
2. Run the example script. The following script trains an ECNet model using the fitness data of the
second RRM domain of Pab1 ([source](https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/19/11/1537.long)). The scripts randomly splits 70% as training data, 10% as validation data, and 20% as test data.
    ```bash
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python scripts/run_example.py \
        --train data/RRM_single.tsv \
        --fasta data/RRM.fasta \
        --local_feature data/RRM.braw \
        --output_dir ./output/RRM_CV \
        --save_prediction \
        --n_ensembles 2 \
        --epochs 100
    ```
    It typically takes no more than 15 min on our tested environment to run this example. The output (printed to stdout) would be the correlation between predicted and ground-truth fitness values.

## Running on your own data
ECNet has two required input files: 1) a FASTA file of the wild-type sequence, and 2) a TSV file describes the fitness values of variants. Other optional input files include the output of CCMPred for extracting local features and separate test TSV file.

1. **Sequence FASTA file** (`--fasta`, required). A regular FASTA file of the wild-type sequence. This file should contain only one sequence.
2. **Fitness TSV file** (`--train`, required). Each line has two columns `mutation` and `score` separated by tab, describing the fitness value of a variant. The `mutation` column is a string has the format `[ref][pos][alt]`, e.g., `S100T`, meaning that the 100-th amino acid (index starting from 1) mutated from `S` to `T`. If a variant has multiple mutations, `;` is used to concatenated mutations. The `score` column is a numerical value quantifies the variant's fitness. Example:    
    ```
    mutation    score
    M1S         1.0
    F12I;L30K   2.0
    G89A        0.06
    ```   
    Note: This file is supplied using the `--train` argument. If no separate test data is provided through the `--test` argument, this TSV file will be split into three sets (train, valid, and test) using ratio specified by `--split_ratio` (which are 3 float numbers). If there is another test TSV file is provided, this TSV file will be split into two sets (train and valid) as specified by `--split_ratio` (which are 2 float numbers).
3. **Local features** (`--local_feature`, optional). A binary file generated by CCMPred using the `-b` option (note that to use the `-b` option you need to install CCMPred from its latest GitHub branch instead of the release; you may also need to install `libmsgpack-dev`. See instructions [below](#generate-local-features-using-hhblits-and-ccmpred)). ECNet will extract local features from this file. This file is optional. If not provided, please add `--no_local_feature` flag when running `run_example.py` (or, equivalently, set `use_local_features=False` for the `ECNet` class) and ECNet won't use the local features. See below for instruction of generating this binary file using HHblits and CCMPred.    
3. **Additional test TSV file** (`--test`, optional). This file has the same format as the `--train` TSV file.

We suggest users tune hyperparameters for new protein. Several hyperparameters are exposed as arguments, e.g., `d_embed`, `d_model`, `d_h`, `n_layers`, etc.

## Generate local features using HHblits and CCMPred
1. Install [HHsuite](https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite) and [CCMPred](https://github.com/soedinglab/CCMpred) following their instructions. Note that CCMPred should be installed from the latest branch instead of the release, otherwise the `-b` option is not available. Also, as CCMPred uses `msgpack` to create the binary file, you may also need to install `libmsgpack-dev` on your system if it is not available. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt update` then `sudo apt install libmsgpack-dev`.
2. Prepare a FASTA file `example.fasta` of the wild-type sequence of our interested protein.
3. Search the homologous sequences of the wild-type sequence using `hhblits` in HHsuite. (There multiple ways to search homologous sequences and format the alignment. Below we describe a way that uses hhblits to search homologous sequences. Other ways are also feasible, e.g., using jackhmmer as described in the [DeepSequence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0138-4) paper.)
    ```bash
    hhblits -i example.fasta \
        -d ${path_to_hhblits_database} \
        -o example.hhr \
        -oa3m example.a3m \
        -n 3 \
        -id 99 \
        -cov 50 \
        -cpu 8
    ```
4. Reformat the a3m output of hhblits to PSICOV format (solution modified from [here](https://github.com/soedinglab/bbcontacts/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md#step-13-reformat-the-output-alignment)). In order to run CCMpred, the alignment must be reformatted to the "PSICOV" format used by CCMpred. We can first use the `reformat.pl` script from the `hh-suite/scripts` directory to get an alignment in fasta format and then the `convert_alignment.py` from the `CCMpred/scripts` directory to get the PSICOV format:
    ```bash
    ${path_to_hh-suite}/scripts/reformat.pl example.a3m example.fas -r
    python ${path_to_CCMpred}/scripts/convert_alignment.py example.fas fasta example.psc
    ```
5. Run CCMPred
    ```bash 
    ccmpred example.psc example.mat -b example.braw -d 0
    ```
6. Use the argument `--local_feature example.braw` to provide the local features to ECNet.

## Train on dataset A and test on dataset B
The following example shows how to train ECNet on dataset A (passed via `--train`) and test it on another dataset B (passed via `--test`).
- Example 1: train on single-mutant fitness data of RRM ([source](https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/19/11/1537.long)), and predict for double-mutants
    ```
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python scripts/run_example.py \
        --train data/RRM_single.tsv \
        --test data/RRM_double.tsv \
        --fasta data/RRM.fasta \
        --split_ratio 0.9 0.1 \
        --local_feature data/RRM.braw \
        --output_dir ./output/RRM \
        --save_checkpoint \
        --n_ensembles 2 \
        --epochs 100
    ```
- Example 2: you can also load the trained model using the `--save_model_dir` argument and predict for test dataset:
    ```
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python scripts/run_example.py \
        --test data/RRM_double.tsv \
        --fasta data/RRM.fasta \
        --local_feature data/RRM.braw \
        --n_ensembles 2 \
        --output_dir ./output/RRM \
        --saved_model_dir ./output/RRM
    ```
